## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder and open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. No build tools or server setup needed — **fully static** site.

### 💡 Tips

- To **customize content**, update the HTML sections directly in `index.html`.
- Replace `src/images/avatar/*` with your own images.
- To use the **contact form**, replace the `publicKey`, `service_id`, and `template_id` in `main.js` with your own [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) credentials.

---

## 📧 EmailJS Integration

- `main.js` handles contact form submission.
- You must configure your own EmailJS account and replace the placeholder keys.
- Alerts display success or failure after attempting to send the message.
